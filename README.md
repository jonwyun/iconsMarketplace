# 3D Icon Set

On this project, I would like to introduce icons that use only lines to create visual illusions. People who see these icons will fall into the illusion of seeing 3D numbers, even though they are simply drawn with lines. First, number icons are prepared, and next, I plan to introduce Korean character icons.

## Usage

Free to use before I have another plan.
